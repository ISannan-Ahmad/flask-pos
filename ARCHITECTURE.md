# Suzuki Auto POS - Architecture Overview

The Flask Point of Sale application operates using a **Modular Blueprint Architecture**. 

Because this application does many things (Sales, Inventory, Purchasing, Ledger), storing everything in `app.py` would result in a monolithic, unmaintainable codebase. Therefore, the application is split into "Blueprints" — mini-applications that are registered together in `app.py`.

## Directory MVP Structure

├── extensions.py          # Centralizes the `db` (SQLAlchemy) instance to prevent circular imports.
